An e-commerce project implemented with Django is a website that allows customers to purchase products online. It is built using the Django web framework and uses the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) technique to handle interactions with the database.

The project includes a product catalog that displays the available products, a shopping cart that allows customers to add items to their cart, and a checkout process to complete the purchase process. The MVT (Model-View-Template) design pattern is used to organize the code and logic of the project.
